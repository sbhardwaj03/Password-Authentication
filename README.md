This Python script performs password verification based on a predefined dictionary of usernames and passwords. It prompts the user to enter a username and then securely input their password using getpass to avoid displaying it on the screen. The script checks if the provided username exists in the dictionary and verifies the password against the stored value. If the password is incorrect, it prompts the user to re-enter it until the correct password is provided. Once the correct password is entered, the script prints "Verified."
